## Side Projects

### Ideal team
 - KGISL/industry professional who understands the value of side projects and impact on his professional growth/prosperity - Read https://j.mp/sideProjectThis
 - KITE faculty/trainer who will interpret the professional's technical objectives of the side project and "translates" into student speak/slang and provides for continuity when 
	 - professional loses interest 
	 - students move on to higher studies / career joining 

 - KITE student team (s) who can implement the same requirement on various technology stacks 
	 - 4th year (1-2) along with 3rd years (as testers) 
 - KITE prospective student from schools, who are "friends of KG" 

### Matching making and Demo Day
- Annual or semi-annual day to provide mentors and students to meet and interact with each other 
	- Demo day at least 2-hourly intervals to trigger interest and inspiration 
	- Opportunity to coopt technology companies and their evangelists (for e.g. Amazon's Alexa Head and/or Vinith and his IMS team) 

### SideProjects Hacakthon 
 
 - Performance oriented - give a jump start to the informal/formal relationships and provide platform for other hackers from geographically distant locations to come and exhibit themselves 
	Themes to be aligned with whatever projects have been ongoing at the campus - that will trigger better motivations for learning and sharing and facilitating their own networking opportunities 

### How to start? How to get ideas?

Use the beginners project list which is published on a weekly basis to bring students / mentors / developers together and then use a remix of the use case stories and develop variants of the same.
